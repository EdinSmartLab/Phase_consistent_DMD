# Phase_consistent_DMD


This is a repository containing MATLAB codes for the preprint:"Phase-consistent dynamic mode decomposition from multiple overlapping spatial domains" by Aditya G. Nair, Benjamin Strom, Bingni W. Brunton and Steven L. Brunton. 

Script: Contains main script for phase-consistent DMD analysis for laminar flow past a circular cylinder.

Data: Contains numerical data for cylinder flow at Re = 100.

Functions: Contains functions for performing DMD and Phase-consistency analysis.

optdmd-master: Contains routines for performing Optimized Dynamic mode decomposition (Refer to ASKHAM,T.& KUTZ,J.N. 2018 "Variable projection methods for an optimized dynamic mode decomposition", SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems 17 (11), 380â€“416 for details).
